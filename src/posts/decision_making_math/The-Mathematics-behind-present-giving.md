I'm sure we've all been in this scenario: we have to choose a present for a close friend or family for whatever reason, but we have no idea what to give them.

Hence, we decide to go to a shopping mall to pick out a present for them. Ok, so now we've arrived at the shopping mall, but there's so many different shops selling so many different items, so what do we do now? We could walk around and visit every shop. Inside the shop, we would look around for different items, pick them up, and then spend some time figuring out if it would be a suitable present - evaluating the item, checking the price etc. This may take some time, you probably also have to backtrack to re-evalaute previous items in order to cross-compare different gifts.

What if there was a more efficient way of choosing a present? Well of course there is, but the real question is, what if there was a more efficient of choosing an equally suitable present? This is where Math and Statistics come in. 

In reality, when we evaluate whether a gift is suitable or not, we actually consider several factors about the gift when making a decision. These can be roughly classified into: price, aesthetics, recipient factor, functionality/practicality, giftability.

Price is pretty easy, this is based on how much you want to spend on the gift. The more expensive an item is, the less inclined you are to buy it. As a matter of fact, the majority of my gift-choosing adventures is trying to find an un-crappy present that is as cheap as possible. 

Second is aesthetics. This is the appearance of the present. No matter how expensive, pratical a present is, any receiver of that present would rather have a version that looked more aesthetically pleasing than an ugly version. This is useful in situations where you are considering accessories, and the appearance of the item that you are buying is a major consideration. 

Third is the recipient factor. This is more of a wild card because it depends entirely on the person whom you are buying the gift for.
