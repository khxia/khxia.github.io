# Top 10 Manga series of All Time 
<small><i>Last updated: September 27th 2020</i></small>
<br/> 

<MangaTable />  

## Details
 

This list includes my favorite manga that I have read. They can, and will change. It should be noted
many of the manga listed above contain links to websites specifically dedicated to that series. Else, 
I have linked the <a href="https://myanimelist.net/">MyAnimeList</a> wiki page for that manga series. 

Again, same as my <Link to="/anime_list">top 10 anime list</Link>, I have not included the super long 
manga series such as **Naruto, One Piece, Bleach** etc. since I feel like it will be unfair comparison. 
Furthermore, I have omitted any Manhwa (Korean webtoons) and Manhua (Chinese webtoons) from my list. 
Again, I think it will be somewhat of a hard comparison. However, this means superb series' such as: 
**Tower of God, God of Highschool, Solo Levelling, 斗破苍穹, 斗罗大陆, 武动乾坤** etc. are sadly excluded
from this list.  

Nevertheless, the manga series' above cover a wide variety of genres and worlds that have personally 
stuck with me. I hope you find this helpful in some way too.
