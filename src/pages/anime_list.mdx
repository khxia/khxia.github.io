# Top 10 Anime of All Time 
<small><i>Last updated: September 27th 2020</i></small>
<br/> 

<AnimeTable />  

## Details
<br/>   

This list includes my favorite anime that I have watched. They can, and will change.
One important thing to note is that I have purposely omitted animes that exceed 24 
episodes per season since it is hard to compare them to standard seasonal anime. Sadly, 
this means that masterpieces such as Naruto, Death Note, Full Metal Alchemist, Hunter x Hunter, 
etc. will not be included.  

The list also does not include anime series that, although I have watched, have started off 
as manga or light novel that I have previously read and fell in love with before the anime 
adaption came out. Such examples include: Kaguya-sama love is war, Shokugeki etc. I have made 
a top 10 manga list specifically dedicated for manga series. (link here)    

Nevertheless, the animes above cover a wide variety of genres that have personally stuck with me.
I hope you find this helpful in some way too.
