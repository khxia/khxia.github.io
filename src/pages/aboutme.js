          üëã Hi, my name is Alex Xia, a sophomore Computer Science major at UCLA. 
          I'm passionate about creating things, learning new things, and teaching people. 
          I mainly code in C++, Python, and JavaScript. 
          Visit my <a target='_blank' href="https://alex-xia.vercel.app" style={{ color: `#ee4466` }}>website</a> to 
          learn more about me and my projects.

            <h3>üé® Interests</h3>
            <p>
              I have a few main hobbies:
          <ul>
                <li><b>Anime</b> - Those who know me are probably aware that I am a massive weeb. I'm a consumer of almost all genres of anime, and if you name any anime or manga title,
            chances are,
            I've watched it. Judge me on <a target='_blank' href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/RoyalCandy" style={{ color: `#ee4466` }}>MAL</a>. 
            </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Games</b> - <strike>Now before people start assuming things, I would like to clarify that I do have some actual
              redeeming qualities. </strike> I really like games a lot, I believe that it's a big part of what brings people together. In fact, what inspired me to
              study CS in the first place was because of computer games. I've been playing <a target='_blank' href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/" style={{ color: `#ee4466` }}> League of Legends </a>
              for almost 6 years, but lately I've been getting quite into <a target='_blank' href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/" style={{ color: `#ee4466` }}>VALORANT</a> and
              {' '}<a target='_blank' href="https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en" style={{ color: `#ee4466` }}>Genshin Impact</a>.
            </li>

                <li>
                  <b>School</b> - Classes are very fun. I get to learn a bunch of cool coding and math stuff. It's really cool to learn about how the magic-y coding stuff isn't all that magic-y after all.
              Aside from academics, I am also an officer at <a target='_blank' href="https://hack.uclaacm.com/" style={{ color: `#ee4466` }}>ACM Hack</a>, where I got to teach some <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/uclaacm" style={{ color: `#ee4466` }}>workshops</a>
                  {' '}and organize some <a target='_blank' href="https://hoth.uclaacm.com/" style={{ color: `#ee4466` }}>hackathons.</a> At Hack, I got to meet the most incredible people who have taught me a lot and has changed me as a person.
